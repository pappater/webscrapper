- Empty URL field
- Invalid URL format
- Failed scraping attempts
- Network connectivity problems

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

### `npm run build`
Builds the application for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized and minified for best performance.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run deploy`
Deploys the built application to GitHub Pages.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Build and deploy the application:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

3. The application will be available at: `https://pappater.github.io/webscrapper`

The deployment process automatically builds the application and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Live Demo

Visit the live application at: [https://pappater.github.io/webscrapper](https://pappater.github.io/webscrapper)

## API Configuration

The application uses the Zenscrape API for web scraping functionality. The current implementation includes a demo API key with limited usage.

### For Production Use

To use this application in production:
1. Obtain your own API key from [Zenscrape](https://www.zenscrape.com/)
2. Replace the API key in `src/App.js`
3. Consider implementing rate limiting and caching
4. Set up your own CORS proxy or configure appropriate CORS headers

### CORS Proxy Note

The application uses `cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com` as a CORS proxy for development. This service has rate limits and is not recommended for production use. Consider setting up your own proxy server for production deployments.

## Browser Compatibility

The application is compatible with modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

Mobile browsers are fully supported with responsive design.
